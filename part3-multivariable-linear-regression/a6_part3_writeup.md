# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
    The r squared coefficent for my model is 0.86. This means that the data is somewhat accurate.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
    Not really accurate because the predicted and the actual values aren't the same. 
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
    The model predicts that a 10-year old car with 89000 miles is worth
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
