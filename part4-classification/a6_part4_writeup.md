# Part 4 - Classification Writeup

After completing `a6_part4.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Comment out the StandardScaler and re-run your test. How accurate is the model? Why is that?
   The data is big because when we used StandardScaler it scaled our data and it isn't as accurate as when we do scale it. 
2. How accurate is the model with the StandardScaler? Is this model accurate enough for the given use case? Explain.
    I think the model with StandardScaler is very accurate because when we compare the actual with the predicted it is the same. 
3. Looking at the predicted and actual results, how did the model do? Was there a pattern to the inputs that the model was incorrect about?
    The model did good. It was not accurate when one of the numbers were negative and the rest were postive. 
4. Would a 34 year old Female who makes 56000 a year buy an SUV according to the model? Remember to scale the data before running it through the model.
    According to the model a 34 year old female wh makes 56000 would buy a SUV
