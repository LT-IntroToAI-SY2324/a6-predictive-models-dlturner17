# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
    The r squared value is 0.66. This shows that the linear regression model 0.66, so it is relatively strong. 
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
    The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old is about 138 
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
    I think this model is somewhat accurate. I don't think it could correctly guess everyones blood pressure because everybodies body is different and we all have different experiences and diets.
